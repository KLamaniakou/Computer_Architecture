## Problem statement:

Write a Risc-V simple game in Ripes, using the D-pad and LED-matrix peripherals:
A single LED of the matix is the "ball". Initially it is white and it apears in the middle of the matrix. The user can move it around the matrix using the D-pad. When the ball reaches any matrix edge, it turns red and stays within the matrix bounds. If it moves away from the edge it turns white again.
